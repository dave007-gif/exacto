# 📐 BuildCost – A Role-Based Construction Take-Off and Estimation App

**BuildCost** is a full-stack web application designed for students, professionals, and firms in the construction industry. It helps users perform detailed and standardized quantity take-offs and cost estimations based on SMM7 and NRM2 methodologies. The app is tailored for the Sub-Saharan African construction context (with a focus on Ghana), incorporating region-specific pricing, plant/labor costs, and haulage considerations.
